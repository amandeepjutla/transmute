# Transmute

## About
`transmute` constitutes a pair of tools that can convert between roughly
equivalent doses of psychiatric drugs. The tools can be run as Python 3 scripts
with no external dependencies.

## Disclaimer
You should not interpret the results `transmute` produces as anything other than
rough approximations. I'm not responsible for anything terrible that might
happen if you don't heed this warning.

## Changelog

### 2019-09-14
- Removed binaries from release - obsolete and basically unnecessary.
